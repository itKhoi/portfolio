                    Hello my name is Khoi Nguyen and I am a recent graduate from
                    the University of California, Irvine (Class of 2021). <br></br>I majored in Computer 
                    Engineering, but am more interested in becoming a full stack software enginner.
                    Pretty early on in my <br></br>college experience, I learned that I was far more interested 
                    in the coding aspect of computer engineering. <br></br>Some of my favorite projects from college include:
                    Creating an automated irrigation system using an Raspberry Pi communicating with a weather 
                    station API, a <br></br>Messenger-like application with a working chess game between users implemented, 
                    and a photo/video filter.

                    <br></br><br></br><br></br>

                    Aside from Computer Engineering, one of my favorite past times is trying great food. One of my favorite YouTubers is 
                    StrictlyDumpling <br></br>and my goal is to try all the places that he has been too. I also love to play video games and some of my favorite games 
                    <br></br>include: 
                    Valorant, Maplestory, and Team Fight Tactics. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have also gotten into custom keyboards and building my own computer. 
                    <br></br>I really enjoy picking up new hobbies that I think are interesting or cool. Recently, 
                    I have been playing basketball almost daily and have started following the NBA.
